# Image Source Method (ISM) for Audio Rendering

Higher-Order Ambisonics (HOA)

This repo implements image source method (ISM) for audio rendering and Higher-Order Ambisonics (HOA) rendering. The features of this repo are: (1) Provide online data rendering for training neural networks. (2) Provide individual ray data insteaded of integrated impulse response data.

## Usage

```python
python test_ism.py
```
