# Image Source Method (ISM) for Audio Rendering

This repository implements the Image Source Method (ISM) for audio rendering and Higher-Order Ambisonics (HOA) rendering. Its key features are: (1) Online data rendering for training neural networks. (2) Fine-grained ray manipulation, allowing users to control individual rays rather than only accessing impulse responses [1].

## Usage

```python
python test_ism.py
```
